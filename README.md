# Symfony-Fundamentals

FYI:  Product + Customer fixtures are in ApiBundle. To test that one bundle can write to another bundles defined entities.

Customer Entity's default ID can be removed if you don't need the performance gain from using local AUTO incrementing id's.
Same is true for the Product entity.

Customer UUID has been set to unique as it should be.
Product ISSN has been set to unique as it should be.
